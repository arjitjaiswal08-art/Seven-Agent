"""Launch-time guard: make `python -m namma_agent` work no matter which interpreter
was typed.

If the app is started with a Python that lacks the project's runtime deps — most
commonly the system `/usr/bin/python` instead of the project virtualenv — the
provider SDK (`openai`) isn't importable, every provider reports "unavailable",
and turns fail with the opaque "All providers failed. Last error: None".

`ensure_venv()` detects that case and re-execs into the project's `.venv`
interpreter so the right packages are present. It's a no-op when the current
interpreter already has the deps, when there's no `.venv`, or when explicitly
disabled with NAMMA_NO_REEXEC=1.

"""Learning nudges — "it's been a while since you studied X" over Telegram.

Spaced practice is one of the strongest effects in learning science, and the
nudge is the agentic half of it: when an active topic with modules still to go
hasn't been touched for ``after_days`` days, Namma Agent pings the user's messaging
channel with their progress and an invitation back.

Like the reminder runner, the background thread is OPT-IN (it rides the same
``scheduler.run_in_background`` switch — no hidden background processes); the
decision logic is pure and unit-tested without threads. Per-topic last-nudge
timestamps persist in a small JSON file so restarts don't re-spam, and a topic
is nudged at most once per ``after_days`` window.

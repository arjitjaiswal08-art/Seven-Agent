"""Safety for Namma Agent — the code-enforceable bits kept from v1.

Two concerns survive into the cloud-only design (the rest was the model's job):

  * :class:`PathSecurity` — filesystem ACCESS POLICY. Namma Agent's files live all over
    the disk (Desktop, Downloads, project folders on other drives…), so READS are
    allowed anywhere on the machine. WRITES / deletes / renames are refused inside
    operating-system and installed-software directories (``C:\\Windows``,
    ``Program Files``, ``/usr``, ``/etc`` …) so the agent can't corrupt the OS or
    your installed programs — those stay effectively read-only. A short list of
    SECRET files (ssh / gpg / aws keys, ``/etc/shadow`` …) is blocked for reads too.
  * :func:`is_destructive` — classify tools that should be approval-gated.

Tune it from ``config.yaml`` under ``security.filesystem`` (see
:func:`configure_path_security`). Prompt-level policy (URL judgment, website
policy, guardrails) is handled by the capable model, not by code.
